Conditional Rendering

This is sometimes when we want to render only some part of our page from the data.
 Here, we render an id open sport from the props anytime it is called.

 we then create a prop called openSpot in our App.js in our card.

 whenyou  console.log (props.openSpots) in the card.js. The number of all openSpots 
 data will appear.

 steps in Card.js
 hard code <div> Sold out </div>

 and set it position: relative in css.

 this appears on the cards.

 To handle conditional rendering we don#t need to always hard code it.
  To be a JS we cover the div in curly braces makeimg it a JS object.

  Using simple JS conditional rendering method- 
  {props.openSpots === 0 && <div> Sold out </div>}

  This means anytime if the first statement is truthy === 0,
  the second statement/the JSX will run and get displayed.

  But if the first statement is falsy, the second statement won't run.
  Therefore it won't be called. 0 is a falsy statement in JS
